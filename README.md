# top-js-todo

The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, Organizing your JavaScript Code, Project: Todo List

### Initial functionality

just get basic lists and items working with just names, all ui elements, events, modules defiend and working; then add other fields and features

-   starting with single todoList containing some mock todoItems
-   read/write set of lists to localstorage
-   no intention of using date-fns at start, more practice doing things with straight js
-   using class for object creation
-   i'm using null for optional field initial values, my thinking being undefined is default state, null is my value so i get different errors
-   starting with arrays, will need to change to a map for priority and sorting

### Requirements

-   add priority, description, due date
-   add sorting; headers should be links that sort alternate asc/des

### Notes

-   Personal preferance with ess6 modules, i hate the existance of defaults, i do not use them.
-   JSON.stringify() only writes out public fields, kind of makes seralizing class with private fields a problem. i don't want to deal with other libraries for seralizing, just keeping it simpler and going all public.
-   Namespace thing; I started with static methods, then switched back to regular functions.
    ```js
    // my prefered aproach is to always qualify code from other modules
    import * as DOMStuff from "./DOMStuff";
    DOMStuff.bind();
    ```

### other features maybe add

-   add the ability to create a user
-   track create/edit date for list and item
-   allow for rearanging lists/items
