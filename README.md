The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, Organizing your JavaScript Code, Project: Todo List


Still some outstanding issues, not fully done, but moving on.

I screwed up reading the spec "choose which project their todos go into".  Spec wants a pile of todos that you assign to lists.  My brain wants you to define a list then add todos to it; every project I looked at did it this way.

I'm not changing at this time, I don't think I like this version, maybe come back and do it from scratch again as an exercise later.


### Notes
- user has to hit the save button, it is not automatic on every edit
- Personal preference with ess6 modules, I hate the existence of defaults, I do not use them.
- `JSON.stringify()` only writes out public fields, kind of makes serializing class with private fields a problem. I have to figure out how I want to deal with it, just keeping it simpler and going all public for now.
- Namespace thing; I started with static methods, then switched back to regular functions.
```js
    // my prefered aproach is to always qualify code from other modules
    import * as DOMStuff from "./DOMStuff";
    DOMStuff.bind();
```

### other features maybe add
- add sorting; I would like to make headers as links that sort alternate asc/des
- something in the UI to rename lists/tasks and edit description
- add the ability to create users
- allow for manual rearranging lists/items; aside from the sort
- a checked task should be pushed to bottom and gray cross-through; excluded from sort
- date input validations, range: min today max ?
- fix alignment problem with description resizing things.
- get rid of the table, just use 1 grid template; first pass has each `<tr>` as a grid layout.
- once the table is gone I lose alternate row color. I want the alternating color.
